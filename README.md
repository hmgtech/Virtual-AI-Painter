# Virtual AI Painter
In this repository, I have created an painter tool which can draw on real-time screen with a finger.

## Demo

## Installation
Before running the AI Painter, make sure to install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. To do this, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command installs all the required dependencies for the AI Painter.

## Usage
Once the libraries are installed, you can run the AI Painter using the following command:

```bash
python VirtualPainter.py
```
For Ubuntu, Linux, or macOS users, use the following command:
```bash
python3 VirtualPainter.py
```

This command launches the AI Painter application, allowing you to explore its creative features.
